The film went on to win a record of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actor (Charlton Heston as Ben Hur).

Everything Is Copy,7.99,"Jacob Bernstein's extremely entertaining film is a tribute to his mother Nora Ephron: Hollywood-raised daughter of screenwriters who grew up to be an ace reporter turned piercingly funny essayist turned novelist/screenwriter/playwright/director.

Watch any given moment of Ephron being her sparkling but caustically witty self (for instance, this response to a scolding talk show host—""You have a soft spot for Julie Nixon, don't you. See, I don't..."") and you find it hard to believe that she’s been gone from our midst for three years.
